## Little Bit About Me

I love coffee, electronic music (BT, Underworld, Royskopp), 80s music, gin, video games (Assasins Creed, Animal Crossing, Mario Kart), and I was a super SCSS nerd back in the day. I am attempting to learn to play the bass guitar but failing at it. My husband Shannon and I have been married for seven years.

I am from the NJ shore but spent my life moving around the country starting in 1997 when I moved to the Bay Area during the first tech bubble to be a "webmaster" for a small web-based software company. I relocated to Las Vegas with the company in 2001 and lived there for five years. I moved to Maryland in 2006, helped raise my nieces for about seven years, and spent my time freelancing and working with small companies to build MVP Rails apps. In 2012, I moved to DC and started working at [LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com/) as a front-end developer in internal tools. I started at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) on April 1, 2013, working remotely from DC. A year later, I moved to SF, worked out of the headquarters for a year, and finally moved back to Vegas on April 1, 2015. In 2022, after almost nine years, I left GitHub to take on an engineering leadership role with [CargoSense](http://www.cargosense.com), focusing on growing and supporting the best software engineering teams. 

## Core Values

### **Progress and Delivery**

I prioritize forward momentum. Whether it's shipping a product, making a decision, or even unshipping a feature, progress is the cornerstone upon which opportunities and great teams are built.

### **Communication, Feedback, and Transparency**

Poor communication is often the root of many problems. I advocate for a culture of open dialogue, verification, and transparency. These elements are key to building trust and fostering an inclusive environment.

### **Trust, Honesty, and Ethical Responsibility**

Trust and honesty are inseparable and foundational for any relationship. Ethical responsibility extends this trust towards society and the environment, ensuring a holistic approach to decision-making.
