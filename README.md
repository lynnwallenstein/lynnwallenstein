## About Me

Born on the NJ shore in 1979. Dropped out of highschool at 16 to move to the bay area to work in tech during the first tech bubble. Relocated to Las Vegas with the company in 2001. Lived there for 5 or so years and then headed back east to Maryland. Freelanced for 5 or so years and then moved to DC for a couple years. Started at GitHub April 1, 2013, moved to SF April 1, 2014 and then moved to Vegas April 1, 2015.

I love coffee, electronic music (BT, Underworld, Royskopp), gin, video games (assasins creed, animal crossing), 80s music, and was a super SCSS nerd back in the day.

## Values

### Progress/Shipping/Delivery

My first priority is always moving forward and getting things done. It is not that I think my other values aren't as important, but having come through my job history of a bunch of failed companies and consulting gigs, the take away was if you aren't showing progress (shipping is one aspect, but also unshipping and making decisions) you don't have the opportuniies and support to build great teams.

### Communication/Feedback

I think poor communication tends to be the core of most problems. It is usually a result of fear (giving someone critical feedback that they won't like, not wanting to ask questions and feel stupid, etc) or when people don't take the time to verify that everyone is on the same page (when in doubt verify and repeat!) and are operating without a shared understanding.

### Trust/Honesty

I think trust and honesty come hand in, you can't have trust without honesty and it takes trust to be honest. I value coming to a relationship with trust and a genuine belief that we are all trying to do our best work and that even in disagreements they are done with the best of intent without maliciousness. Part of this trust also comes between our teams and our leadership to deal with situations where the above is not true in a fair and swift manner.
