## Little Bit About Me

I love coffee, electronic music (BT, Underworld, Royskopp), 80s music, gin, video games (Assasins Creed, Animal Crossing, Mario Kart), and I was a super SCSS nerd back in the day. I am attempting to learn to play the bass guitar but failing at it. My husband Shannon and I have been married for five years, and we have a cat roommate, Oen, who tolerates us.

I am from the NJ shore but spent my life moving around the country starting in 1997 when I moved to the Bay Area during the first tech bubble to be a "webmaster" for a small web-based software company. I relocated to Las Vegas with the company in 2001 and lived there for five years. I moved to Maryland in 2006, helped raise my nieces for about 7 years, and spent my time freelancing and working with small companies to build MVP Rails apps. In 2012 I moved to DC and started working at [LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com/) as a front-end developer in internal tools. I started at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) on April 1, 2013, working remotely from DC. A year later, I moved to SF, worked out of the headquarters for a year, and finally moved back to Vegas on April 1, 2015. In 2022, after almost nine years, I left GitHub to take on an engineering leadership role with [CargoSense](http://www.cargosense.com), focusing on growing and supporting the best software engineering teams. 

## Values

### **Progress and Delivery**

My journey through various roles and companies has taught me the importance of forward momentum. Progress—be it shipping a product, making a decision, or even unshipping a feature—is the lifeblood of opportunity. It's the foundation upon which great teams are built.

### **Communication and Feedback**

The root of most problems lies in poor communication. Whether it's fear of giving critical feedback or failing to ensure everyone is on the same page, bad communication is the source of many work related problems. I advocate for a culture of open dialogue, where verification and repetition are the norms.

### **Trust and Honesty**

Trust and honesty are two sides of the same coin. I value relationships built on these tenets, where everyone is assumed to act with the best of intentions. This trust extends to the relationship between teams and leadership, ensuring a fair and swift resolution of any issues.
